Hi, I go by Torph online. I'm mainly a C/C++ programmer, usually making mods for PC & console games.
I'm also a first-year Computer Science student. I graduated high school in 2023, so most of my projects
were written or started in high school.

# Specialties
I mostly work with binary file formats (as a product of game modding). Recently, I've been researching
CPU recompilers and HLE designs. I've also done a few projects involving process injection on Windows
(for mods, as usual).
